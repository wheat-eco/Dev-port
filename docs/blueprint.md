- Primary color: Soft White (#F0F0F0) to create a clean and modern backdrop for showcasing content, referencing the user's mention of 'white'.
- Background color: Desaturated Purple (#2A2734) for a sophisticated and techy vibe, building on the original color request for 'dark purple and blue.'
- Accent color: Muted Blue (#73A3B1) as an accent, lending an impression of personal style and technological sophistication.
- Body: 'PT Sans', a versatile humanist sans-serif font; Headline: 'Playfair', an elegant modern serif; the pairing will present the information clearly with a professional feel.
- Custom downloadable icons in the public folder (Material UI icons).
- A modern, responsive layout with a clear information hierarchy that ensures easy navigation and readability across all devices. 
- Use typing animations in the hero section, subtle scroll-based animations, and interactive transitions to enhance user engagement and create a dynamic experience. The entire UI should feature carefully chosen animations that create an unforgettable user experience, making sure the interface has elements that are clearly interactive, reactive, and/or animated.
